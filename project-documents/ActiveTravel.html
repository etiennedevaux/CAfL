          <h1>Air Quality in Leamington Spa</h1>
          <p>Air pollution is a serious public health issue. It contributes to about 1 in 20 deaths in our town and affects the well-being of many of us, especially those with existing medical conditions. Everyone deserves to breathe clean, safe air that is within internationally agreed limits.</p> 
          <p class="cafl-quote">"Clean air is a basic requirement of human health and well-being. Air pollution, however, continues to pose a significant threat to health worldwide."</p>

          <p>Warwick District Council figures show that traffic emissions are the biggest cause of local air pollution so Clean Air for Leamington is focusing on changing the way we travel to and move around our town.</p>
          <p class="cafl-quote">"Air pollution is associated with a number of adverse health impacts. It is recognised as a contributing factor in the onset of heart disease and cancer. Additionally, air pollution particularly affects the most vulnerable in society: children and older people, and those with heart and lung conditions."</p>

        <h1>Improve Our Town</h1>
        <p>We know that clean air is a key improvement that people want.  As a result, local government, businesses and private households in the town are all doing things around you to help promote a better, cleaner environment.</p>
        <p>The first objective in the ‘Transport’ section of the Royal Leamington Spa Neighbourhood Development Plan is ‘To reduce vehicle traffic emissions, improve air quality and increase access to and use of sustainable transport modes across Royal Leamington Spa’.</p>
      
        <p>Below are some examples of organisations doing their bit for Clean Air in Leamington Spa:</p>

        
        <section id="cafl-improve-cafl" class="cafl-improve-dropdown">
          <h1><button class="cafl-expand"><i class="fas fa-plus"></i></button><button class="cafl-collapse"><i class="fas fa-minus"></i></button> Clean Air for Leamington Spa </h1>
          <p class="cafl-improve-detail">Clean Air for Leamington Spa is actively working to achieve our vision of a town where air quality is excellent, people are prioritised over vehicles, there is a high degree of active travel and people actively support clean air.  Some highlights include:</p>

            <ul  class="cafl-improve-detail">
              <li>Anti-Idling</li>
              <li>Clean Air for Leamington Spa Website</li>
              <li>Social Media Presence</li>
              <li>Raising Clean Air Concerns with Local Government</li>
              <li>Liaison with Clean Air Warwick</li>
              <li>Liaison with Cycleways</li>
            </ul>

          <p  class="cafl-improve-detail">We have been working with WCC transport planners, trying to understand current measures intended to improve air quality and encourage planning decisions that prioritise sustainable modes of transport rather than motor vehicles. A Clean Air Zone is being explored, as are 20mph limits in town, and a comprehensive cycle network. As well as infrastructure changes, we want to see the behavioural changes, like ride-share to work and walk to school schemes that will decrease traffic flow and improve air quality. Our Air Quality Summit last October chaired by our MP Matt Western captured public attention and generated a lot of enthusiasm.</p>

      <p>Keeping the air clean does not just depend on what those around you are doing, you can make a big difference with some small changes.</p>
      <p>The biggest source of air pollution is motorised transport, so most of our suggestions focus on how you move around the town.</p>

        <p class="cafl-improve-detail">If your work is very close you may be fortunate enough to be able to walk, if not then consider cycling.  For longer commutes, public transport is usually the cleanest and least expensive option, use it if you can.</p>
        <p class="cafl-improve-detail">If you really have to use a car for work, then take comfort from the others who are avoiding using their cars, making your commute less congested, shorter and less stressful.</p>

        <p class="cafl-improve-detail">After motorised transport, the next biggest contributor to air pollution is burning wood or fossil fuels.  Almost whatever you are burning it is likely to be adding to air pollution, burning garden waste is one of the biggest sources of harmful particulates.  The more you avoid burning wood, coal or other fossil fuels the cleaner the air will be.</p>

      <h1>What We Do in Clean Air for Leamington Spa</h1>
      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>Clean Air for Leamington wants Royal Leamington Spa to be a town:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>with excellent air quality everywhere</li>
        <li>where people - walkers and cyclists, babies in pushchairs and mobility scooter users - are prioritised over motorised traffic</li>
        <li>where there is a high degree of active travel</li>
        <li>where people actively support campaigns and measures that promote clean air.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Our Aims</h2>
      <p>In order to achieve this vision Clean Air for Leamington will aim to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>raise the community’s awareness of the problem of air pollution and its impacts on health and wellbeing</li>
        <li>raise the community’s awareness of CAfL, its vision and plan of activities and how everyone can contribute</li>
        <li>collaborate with other ‘interest groups’ and sister organisations to coordinate activities and focus resources</li>
        <li>work with, support and influence the Town, District and County councils</li>
        <li>devise, lead, co-ordinate and facilitate specific initiatives and events - e.g. School Streets, anti-idling campaign etc.</li>
      </ul>
